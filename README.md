# AVL Tree Implementation in C++

## Description

This project is an implementation of the AVL tree in C++. The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which for each node the difference in the heights of the subtrees does not exceed one. This guarantees logarithmic complexity of search, insertion and deletion operations.

## Functionality

- Inserting elements
- Deleting elements
- Finding an element
- Listing tree contents in ascending order (inflex traversal)
- Getting tree height and balance

## Installation

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer:

git clone https://github.com/your_user/avl-tree.git

2. Go to the project directory:

cd avl-tree

3. Compile the code with g++:

g++ main.cpp -o avl_tree

4. Run the program:

./avl_tree

## Usage examples

The program provides a command interface for interacting with the AVL tree. You can enter commands to add, delete, and find elements.

Example commands:
- insert <number> - insert a number into the tree.
- remove <number> - delete a number from the tree.
- search <number> - find a number in the tree.
- print - print all tree elements.
- height - print the height of the tree.
- inOrder Traveral.

## Project structure

- main.cpp - the main program file containing the implemented AVL tree and test examples.
